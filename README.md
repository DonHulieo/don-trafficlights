# don-trafficlights

Traffic Lights Logic for QBCore! This is a paid script, available on my [Tebex](https://dons-developments.tebex.io/package/5370160).

## Optional Dependencies

- [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
- [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy)

## Features

- Optimised code, resmon of 0~0.1ms. Peaking for civilians when stopped at lights and when LEO's have sirens on near traffic lights.
- Config Option for ESX or QBCore!
- Set the duration of traffic lights for players, lights will turn green after car has been stopped for the duration.
- Traffic Lights go green if player is an LEO and has sirens on.
- Local traffic now see's the updated signals, and will drive when the light turns green and halt when the light turns red.

## Important Config

```lua
Config.Framework = 'QBCore'
Config.JobCheck = 'FirstResponder'
Config.DebugMode = false
```

- `Framework` - Set to either 'QBCore', 'ESX' or 'None' depending on your server's framework.
- `JobCheck` - Set to the job type you want to check for, this is only used if you're using QBCore or ESX.
- `DebugMode` - Set to true if you want to see debug messages in the console and markers for the affected lights and vehicles.

```lua
Config.Search = {
    lightDist = 80.0,
    vehicles = true,
    vehDist = 80.0,
    headingThres = 45.0,
    maxLights = 8, -- Max amount of lights to set at once
    maxVehicles = 16 -- Max amount of vehicles to set at once
}
```

- `lightDist` - The max distance to search for traffic lights, this is the distance from the player to the traffic light.
- `vehicles` - Set to true if you want to search for vehicles, this will ensure the vehicles within the search radius are 'aware' of the traffic light changes.
- `vehDist` - The max distance to search for vehicles, this is the distance from the player to the vehicle and the vehicle to the traffic light.
- `headingThres` - The max angle the vehicle can be facing away from the traffic light, this is to ensure the vehicle is facing the traffic light.
- `maxLights` - The max amount of lights to set at once, this is to ensure the server doesn't lag when setting the lights.
- `maxVehicles` - The max amount of vehicles to set at once, this is to ensure the server doesn't lag when setting the lights.

**Note:** The vehicle search feature is quite intensive, if you're experiencing lag or performance issues when setting the lights, set `vehicles` to false.

```lua
Config.Duration = {
    civCheckTime = 1000,
    leoCheckTime = 500,
    lightTime = 3500,
    leoLightTime = 7500
}
```

- `civCheckTime` - The time in milliseconds to check if a civilian is stopped at a traffic light.
- `leoCheckTime` - The time in milliseconds to check if a LEO is stopped at a traffic light.
- `lightTime` - The time in milliseconds for the traffic light to stay green for civilians.
- `leoLightTime` - The time in milliseconds for the traffic light to stay green for LEO's.

## LEO's

- Set your server's emergency service related job names (if they're different) in Config.AuthorizedJobs.
